      With long, blonde hair for most of his life, Skylar was first diagnosed
      with Alopecia when he was 16. Six months later, Skylar was completely
      bald. Today, Skylar is still definitely bald, but instead of rejecting his
      baldness, Skylar owns his identity as an alopecian. Now, Skylar is taking
      a hiatus as a softare engineer to help others do the same.
