  Adventures for Alopecia is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization serving the
  community of people affected by the autoimmune skin disease Alopecia. We will
  acheive our mission through three main program areas: support, awareness, and
  research.


  Our support program will consist of hosting support group events throughout
  North, Central, and South America, while our awareness program aims to educate
  the public about Alopecia through social media, press, word of mouth, and
  speaking engagements.


  For our research efforts, we will partner with the existing 501(c)(3)
  nonprofit organization NAAF to sponsor their exisiting Alopecia Research
  Development Program.


  In the future, we hope to sponsor adventures for other people afflicted by
  Alopecia to inspire confidence through travel and adventure.
