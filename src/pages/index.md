  reason1:
    belief: Emotional pain is real
    description1: "Alopecia isn’t deadly, but it does kill confidence, perceived identity, and emotional well-being — especially for children and young adults. It can appear at any age and affects all races and sexes."
    description2: >-
      Support plays a big part in helping people with Alopecia regain their
      confidence, maintain a positive outlook, and overcome this emotional pain caused by this disease.
  reason2:
    belief: No acceptable treatment exists
    description1: "The best treatments are far from good. From acidic ointments to powerful pills that affect the immune system to steroidal injections, current treatment options often bring serious side effects and are rarely effective."
    description2: >-
      With more funding for research, we hope that our treatments options become
      more effective and less detrimental. 
  reason3:
    belief: 'Big impact, little attention'
    description1: >-
      Alopecia affects 145 million individuals—that's 2% of the population! But very
      few people actually know what Alopecia is. That’s often because people
      with Alopecia feel they can’t discuss it and have to hide it with wigs,
      hats, and makeup to feel accepted. 
    description2: >-
      With increased public awareness of Alopecia, those dealing with the
      disease will be able to find acceptance.
