  reason:
    belief: Emotional pain is real
    description: "Alopecia isn’t deadly, but it does kill confidence, perceived identity, and emotional well-being. It can appear at\Lany age and affects all races and sexes."
    description1: >-
      Support plays a big part in helping people with Alopecia regain their
      confidence, maintain a positive outlook, and overcome this emotional pain.
  reason2:
    belief: No acceptable treatment
    description: "The best treatments are far from good. From acidic ointments to strong pills to steroidal injections, current treatment options include serious side effects and\Lare often ineffective."
    description2: >-
      With more funding for research, we hope that our treatments options become
      more effective and less detrimental. 
  reason3:
    belief: 'Big impact, little attention'
    description: >-
      Alopecia affects 145 million people—2% of the population. However, very
      few people actually know what Alopecia is. That’s often because people
      with Alopecia feel they can’t discuss it and have to hide it with wigs,
      hats, and makeup to achieve acceptance. 
    description2: >-
      With increased public awareness of Alopecia, those dealing with the
      disease will be able to find acceptance.
