      After having long, blonde hair throughout his youth, Skylar was first
      diagnosed with Alopecia when he was 16. Six months later, Skylar was
      completely bald. Today, Skylar has Alopecia Universalis—the complete loss
      of hair on the body—but instead of rejecting his baldness, Skylar owns his
      identity as an alopecian. Now, Skylar is taking a hiatus from software
      engineering to help others alopecians own their identity as well.
