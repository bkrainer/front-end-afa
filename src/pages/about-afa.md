    Adventures for Alopecia is a nonprofit organization supporting children and adults living with Alopecia.  We
    achieve our mission through three main program areas: support, awareness, and research.  


    Our **support** program will consist of hosting support group events

    throughout North, Central, and South America.  

    Our **awareness** program aims to educate the public about Alopecia through social media, press, word of

    mouth, and speaking engagements.  

    For our **research** efforts, we will partner with the existing 501(c)(3)

    nonprofit organization NAAF to sponsor their exisiting Alopecia Research

    Development Program.  


    In the future, we hope to sponsor adventures for other people afflicted by

    Alopecia so they can regain confidence through travel and adventure.

    Alopecia areata is a common autoimmune skin disease, causing rapid, unpredictable hair loss on the scalp, face, and sometimes the entire body. Over six million people in the U.S. have been diagnosed with it, and an individual's lifetime risk of Alopecia is 2.1%. 
  definition2: >
    People of all ages, both sexes, and all ethnic groups can develop Alopecia areata. It can first appear during childhood or adulthood, and though physically benign, Alopecia can have devastating effects on one’s mental, emotional, and social wellbeing.

      Having long, blonde hair all throughout his youth, Skylar was 
      diagnosed with Alopecia when he was 16 after finding a dime-sized bald spot on the back of his head.
      Six months later, Skylar had become completely bald—a unique look for a sophomore in high school. That uncontrolled transition took a toll on Skylar's emotional well-being and confidence throughout high school. 
      Over the past 9 years, Skylar has embraced his Alopecia and learned to recognize it as an important
      part of his identity. Now, Skylar is embarking on the
      adventure of his dreams to prove that Alopecia is not an inhibitor and to
      encourage other Alopecians to own their identity as well.
